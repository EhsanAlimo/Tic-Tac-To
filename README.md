# Tic Tac Toe

## This project was the first solo project that I have done as a GA student.

I have used some simple `html` to define seperate boxes and `Jquery` has been used as a `Javascript` library to implement the changes reponsive to the events that happen in the game while you playing it.

To access the gameboard please use this [link](https://ehsanalimo.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/).
